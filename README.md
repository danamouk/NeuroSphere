# Overview

Medical image segmentation and classification play pivotal roles in effective image retrieval and decision-making within image analysis. This involves utilizing machine learning algorithms with diverse medical images to determine patient classes and enable rapid, scalable diagnoses. The integration of MONAI Data API tools enhances data processing efficiency, proving invaluable in detecting structural brain abnormalities and aiding in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Vascular dementia diagnoses using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Employing image segmentation and classification methods, particularly voxel-based analysis and 3D-DenseNet, is instrumental, especially on 3D MRI axial and sagittal T2-weighted images, for accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's and Vascular dementia patients.
