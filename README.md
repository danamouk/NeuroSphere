# Overview

Medical image segmentation and classification are crucial for effective medical image retrieval and play a vital role in decision-making within medical image analysis. Utilizing machine learning algorithms alongside diverse medical images, these tasks contribute to determining a patient's class and facilitating rapid and scalable diagnoses. Methods involving image segmentation and classification prove invaluable in detecting structural abnormalities in the human brain, specifically aiding in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Vascular dementia patients. Notably, voxel-based analysis, an unsupervised image segmentation approach, and the implementation of 3D-DenseNet are employed for segmentation and classification tasks, particularly on 3D MRI axial and sagittal T2-weighted images for Alzheimer's and Vascular dementia patients.
